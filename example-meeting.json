  "overview": [
    "The real estate landscape for 2026 is characterized by significant shifts in federal tax policy, a gradual decline in mortgage rates, and fundamental changes to industry association support structures.",
    "A landmark tax bill, signed July 4, 2025, represents the most substantial change to the tax code since 2017, notably quadrupling the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. This change is expected to incentivize itemization among homeowners, particularly in high-tax regions like California.",
    "Concurrently, mortgage rates are trending downward, with jumbo loans reaching approximately 5.875% in early 2026, stimulating buyer demand.",
    "The industry faces regulatory tightening regarding referral disclosures (via the new RAD form) and a transition in marketing group operations as regional associations like Bay East withdraw financial and administrative support.",
    "Professionals are advised to prioritize meticulous record-keeping for mileage and home offices, as the IRS increases its focus on 1099-K reporting and cryptocurrency."

  "insights": [
    "🏛️ Tax Law Overhaul (July 4, 2025): SALT deduction cap quadrupled from $10,000 to $40,000, standard deductions increased (Joint: $31,515, Single: $15,750), Qualified Business Income (QBI) made permanent, and new $10,000 car interest deduction for US-assembled vehicles.",
    "💰 Business Incentives Restored: Bonus depreciation reinstated for purchases after January 19 (100% first-year write-off for equipment/technology). Section 179 expensing allows immediate deduction of business assets. Real estate professionals must document 750+ hours annually to offset active income with rental losses.",
    "📊 IRS Reporting Changes: 1099-K threshold dropping to $600 for third-party platforms (Venmo, PayPal). 1099-MISC/NEC threshold increasing from $600 to $2,000. Cryptocurrency tracking significantly enhanced with stricter reporting requirements for all crypto-related investments.",
    "🔍 Audit Red Flags & Best Practices: Maintain separate business/personal accounts to avoid co-mingling. Document mileage with contemporary logs ($0.70/mile for 2025). Obtain oil changes in December/January for odometer verification. Ensure expenses are 'ordinary and necessary' - avoid excessive luxury claims.",
    "📋 New RAD Form Requirement: California Association of Realtors mandates Referral Addendum Disclosure form for complete transparency in referral compensation. Must disclose every detail of compensation received for referrals to eliminate 'secret' payments.",
    "🏢 Bay East Association Withdrawal: As of January 30, 2026, Bay East ends financial/staff support for local marketing groups (Tri-City, Castro Valley, Pleasanton). Groups must become self-sustaining through sponsorships, merge, or disband. Some brokerages offering free venues to maintain networking opportunities.",
    "💡 Strategic Tax Planning: Independent contractors face two paths - (1) Tax Minimization: maximize expenses to lower net income and tax burden, or (2) Income Justification: show higher net income for loan qualification while contributing up to $70,000 (or 25% of income) to self-employment retirement accounts. Ages 60-63 qualify for 'Super Catch-Up' provision with additional $11,000 retirement contributions.",
    "📉 Interest Rate Environment: Jumbo loan rates decreased from 6% to 5.875% for zero-point loans, stimulating buyer demand. Properties in $1.1M-$1.2M range attracting 50+ buyers at open houses. Bond market (not Federal Reserve) remains primary driver of rate movements.",
    "🏡 Down Payment Assistance Programs: Zero-Down options available (second mortgage for 3% down at ~6.75% rate, 600+ credit score required). CalHFA 'Dream for All' provides 20% down via equity-share (state receives 20% of appreciation), limited to first-generation homebuyers, lottery selection in April 2026. Alameda County program lotteries held annually in May and September."
